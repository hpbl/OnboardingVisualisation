### Linting

This project uses linting to keep a cohesive code-style, so installation of `eslint` and `stylelint` plugins for your editor/IDE are recommended.

If you don't want to install plugins, don't worry, the linter is run everytime you attemp to make a commit, and if there are any errors, you'll can see them on the terminal/command line.

>If you are using another editor please add it along with it's plug-ins to the list below.

#### On Atom
